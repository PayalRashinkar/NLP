I have created 2 separate folders for task1 and task2 containing all the required files.

To run the script, please make sure that the data folder containing the train,test and dev file is in the same folder as the task1.py or task1.ipynb file that you will use for running.

Also the glove file is required to be in the same path as the scripts for task2.

Command to run:

python3 task1.py

task1.py runs 15 epocs

python3 task2.py

task2.py runs 20 epocs

You can either execute python code or .ipynb file (Tested on jupyter notebook).
