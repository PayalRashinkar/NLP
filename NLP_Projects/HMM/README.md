# HMM

**Description:**
1. Built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using the Penn Treebank dataset, implementing vocabulary creation, model learning, and both Greedy and Viterbi decoding algorithms.
2. Achieved POS tagging accuracy by optimizing emission and transition probabilities, evaluating model predictions using custom evaluation scripts, and automating results output for development and test datasets.


**Skills:**
Programming and Libraries: Python, JSON handling
Statistical Modeling: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) implementation
Algorithms:
Greedy Decoding Algorithm for sequence tagging
Viterbi Decoding Algorithm for optimal POS tagging
Data Preprocessing: Vocabulary generation with unknown word handling
Model Evaluation: Accuracy calculation using gold-standard evaluation scripts
File Handling: Text parsing, result output generation (vocab.txt, hmm.json, predictions)
Tools: Python scripting, command-line execution
